Und ich arbeite m√∂glichst auch t√§glich mit den √úbungen, Aufnahmen und Karten / Quizlet von ""Italiano Spontaneo"". (Evtl. werde ich mir auch noch das gedruckte Buch dazu bestellen, falls es eines gibt. Sonst arbeite ich eben nur mit dem eBook, welches ich ja bereits gekauft habe.) In diesem Buch will ich die erste Lektion auf jeden Fall schaffen und m√∂glichst auch noch die Zweite. Ich werde mich dabei an die im eBook beschriebene ""Schildkr√∂tenmedthode"" halten. Aber je nachdem, wie mein Kenntnisstand der Lektion nach einigen Tagen oder so ist (ich habe ja auch bereits ein paar Vorkenntnisse), k√ºrze ich die sieben Tage pro Kapitel evtl. ab und beginne dann schon fr√ºher mit der n√§chsten Lektion. Ich werde auch die bereits vor meinem Shot gelernten Inhalte aus dem Power-Sprachkurs wiederholen.\nZus√§tzlich arbeite ich m√∂glichst oft auch noch mit der LearnItalian-App, evtl. der Quizlet-App, dem Grammatischen Lernlexikon vom Reclam-Verlag und den Adesso-Materialien. In dem Grammatischen Lernlexikon werde ich die gelernten Themen nachschlagen, nachlesen, wiederholen und die Kurztests bearbeiten - wenn ich mit einem Abschnitt fertig bin. Weiterhin werde ich mit dem Kauderwelsch-3in1-Sprachf√ºhrer arbeiten - in diesem v.a. auch mit dem Buchteil zur Slang-Sprache -, dem Langenscheidt-Sprachf√ºhrer und evtl. auch mit dem Pinhok-eBook, dem von Flashcardo und/oder ""Italienisch lernen mal anders"". Vielleicht arbeite ich auch mit meinem Grundwortschatz-eBook von Langenscheidt und meinem (gedruckten) ""Mitmach-Sprachf√ºhrer""\nDes Weiteren will ich auch m√∂glichst oft ""meine eigenen"" Lerntechniken anwenden, wie Wortschatz- und Grammatik-Flashcards schreiben und damit lernen, evtl. auch ""Standard-Vokabelkarten"" aus Papier mit einem Karteikasten.""']",Education & Knowledge
